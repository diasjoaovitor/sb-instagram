# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Project Conventions

### Scope

An open-source, non-profit tool for supermarkets to create Instagram offer posts. The UI side uses **shadcn/ui** as the component library, with its theme and Tailwind's default palette kept as they come (see Styling & UI).

- **Self-hosted, one instance per store.** The app ships as a Docker image that each store runs itself. There is no hosted service and no multi-tenancy: never design for several stores sharing one instance, and never send store data anywhere outside the instance.
- **Storage:** SQLite, in a file inside the instance's data volume. Photos uploaded by the store live in the same volume, never in git.
- **No login in v1.** The instance runs on the store's network; whoever reaches the URL can use it.
- **Store branding is data, not code.** Logo, colors, slogan and Instagram handle are configured per instance in the app, so nothing store-specific (including Supermercado Baratão, where the project started) is hardcoded.
- **Products are keyed by code:** the barcode (EAN) when the product has one, otherwise the store's internal code (the one used by its POS or scale). Barcodes are read from a USB scanner or typed; camera scanning is out of v1.
- **Community catalog.** The only content versioned in git and open to contributions is the product catalog, in two folders: products with an EAN (an image plus a data file with name, brand and unit, both named after the EAN) and products without an EAN (images only, named after the product description, e.g. `picanha-bovina.webp`). Internal codes differ from store to store, so a product without an EAN never enters the catalog by its code: the store assigns a catalog image to its own internal code.
- **Out of v1:** publishing to Instagram, scheduling, AI-generated captions and a visual template editor. Don't add them without an issue.

### Language

- **Portuguese:** `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, GitHub issues (titles and bodies), the issue template and all user-facing text in the app.
- **English:** code (identifiers and comments), commit messages, branch names, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/` and the AI workflow under `.claude/`.

### Package manager

- Use **pnpm** only (not npm/yarn).
- Versions are pinned exact (no `^`/`~`) only for `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in `package.json`, no exceptions there. Install new deps with `pnpm add -E <pkg>` (or `pnpm add -D -E <pkg>` for dev deps) — never hand-edit version strings.
- `-E` only takes effect when no version is given. `pnpm add -E <pkg>@<version>` (or `@latest`) and packages already in `package.json` still get a `^`. In those cases, remove the carets right after (`sed -i -E 's/"\^([0-9])/"\1/' package.json`) and run `pnpm install`.
- The exact-version rule does not apply to MCP servers (`.mcp.json`) or `package.json` scripts, which may use `@latest` (e.g. `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest`, `pnpm dlx @playwright/mcp@latest`). They must still run through pnpm, never `npx`.
- Node version is pinned in `.nvmrc` (`lts/krypton`) for local use and in `engines.node` (`24.x`) in `package.json` for hosts that ignore `.nvmrc` (e.g. Vercel). Keep both on the same major.
- On Vercel, set `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK=1` (Production and Preview) so the build uses the exact pnpm version from `packageManager`; without it Vercel picks pnpm from the lockfile version.
- `@/*` resolves to `src/*` (`tsconfig.json`).

### Project structure

- `src/app` holds frontend-exclusive content only — there's no top-level `src/components` or `src/helpers`, that shared code lives under `src/app` instead.
- Anything that isn't frontend-exclusive (e.g. `src/tests`, and any future non-frontend folder) lives directly under `src`, as a sibling of `app`, not nested inside it.
- Routes are grouped under `src/app/(pages)` (a route group, so it doesn't affect the URL).
- Shared frontend code lives in `src/app/components`, React hooks in `src/app/hooks` and other helpers in `src/app/helpers` (create them when the first one is needed). The `lib` alias in `components.json` points to `src/app/lib`, which doesn't exist: if the shadcn CLI ever creates something there, keep it in `lib` or move it to `helpers` case by case.
- There are no `index.ts` barrels: import each module directly from its file through the `@/` alias (e.g. `@/app/components/ui/shadcn/button`). Barrels cause circular imports, give two import paths for the same module and make Vite/Vitest load every re-exported module.
- `src/app/components` groups components by role: `ui/` for visual building blocks (shadcn ones under `ui/shadcn/`, our own under `ui/custom/`), `blocks/` for composed pieces reused across pages, grouped by domain (e.g. `blocks/post/`; a block that belongs to no domain stays directly in `blocks/`), `providers/` for context providers without UI of their own and `layouts/` for page shells.
- A layout lives in its own folder (`layouts/<name>/index.tsx`), with the parts only it uses in a private `_components/` folder next to it. Code outside the layout imports only `layouts/<name>`, never its `_components/`. The same goes for a route: parts used by a single page live in a `_components/` folder next to it.
- `favicon.ico` stays directly in `src/app/`, not nested in a route group.
- React Compiler is enabled (`reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.ts`, `babel-plugin-react-compiler` devDependency).

### Linting & formatting

- ESLint uses native flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`), extending the `core-web-vitals`/`typescript` configs from `eslint-config-next`, plus `eslint-plugin-unicorn`, `eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort`, `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss`, `eslint-plugin-promise`, `eslint-plugin-prefer-arrow-functions`, `eslint-config-prettier`, and `@eslint/json`/`@eslint/markdown` for JSON/Markdown files. Markdown files use the `gfm` language with `frontmatter: 'yaml'`, so the frontmatter of issue templates (or any Markdown content) isn't parsed as Markdown. `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss` rule docs are in `node_modules/eslint-plugin-tailwindcss/docs/rules/` — check there before overriding a Tailwind lint rule.
- `eslint-plugin-unicorn@74` declares a peer of `eslint >=10.4`, but the project stays on ESLint 9 (`9.39.5`). The peer is unmet (`pnpm peers check` reports it, and depending on the pnpm version install warns `Issues with peer dependencies found`), but `pnpm eslint:check` passes. Don't bump one without validating the other.
- `next lint` no longer exists (removed in Next.js 16). Use `pnpm eslint:check` / `pnpm eslint:fix` and `pnpm prettier:check` / `pnpm prettier:fix`.
- `pnpm type-check` runs `next typegen` first: globals such as `LayoutProps` are generated into `.next/types`, so a clean checkout (CI, fresh clone) fails `tsc --noEmit` without it.
- Prettier style: single quotes, no semicolons, no trailing commas (`.prettierrc`).
- Base indentation/whitespace rules (2 spaces, LF, trim trailing whitespace, final newline) are enforced editor-side via `.editorconfig`.

### Code comments

- Comments only record **why** a decision was made, ideally with a reference (docs link, issue number, upstream bug). Never write comments that explain what the code does or how it works.
- Default to no comment. Add one only for a non-obvious choice that someone might "fix" by mistake.
- Write comments in English.

### Git hooks (husky)

- `pre-commit`: runs `lint-staged` (`lint-staged.config.js`) — prettier + eslint + `vitest related --passWithNoTests` scoped per staged file type, invoked directly via `pnpm exec` rather than through `package.json` scripts.
- `commit-msg`: auto-prepends the emoji prefix from the Commit Rules below based on the leading word (e.g. `feat: ...` → `✨ feat: ...`), then runs `commitlint` (`commitlint-config-emoji-convention`). You can type the plain word and let the hook add the emoji.
- `pre-push`: runs `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm test:e2e` (full Playwright suite).

### Testing

- Unit tests: **Vitest** (`vitest.config.mts`), `jsdom` environment, native Vite `resolve.tsconfigPaths` (no `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin needed). Only picks up `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`. Component tests use `@testing-library/react` / `@testing-library/dom`. `vitest.setup.ts` (`setupFiles`) runs Testing Library's `cleanup` after every test, so test files don't repeat `afterEach(cleanup)`.
- E2E tests: **Playwright** (`playwright.config.ts`), tests live in `src/tests/e2e`, single `chromium` project, `webServer` auto-starts `pnpm dev` against `http://localhost:3000`. Failure artifacts go to `test-results/` (git- and ESLint-ignored). There are no global retries: a known flaky test gets `test.describe.configure({ retries })` in its own `describe`, with a comment linking the issue that tracks it.
- Only test logic we wrote (filtering, lookups, mappings, transforms). Don't test library or framework behavior (e.g. a component that only passes props or HTML through, schema defaults, `Link` routing), and drop a test whose main cost is a mock needed only to render. Prefer a unit test; add an e2e test only for what a unit test can't cover.
- Scripts: `pnpm test` (unit, run once) / `pnpm test:watch` (unit, watch mode) / `pnpm test:e2e` (e2e) / `pnpm test:e2e:ui` (e2e, Playwright UI mode).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, triggered on `pull_request`) runs, in order: `commitlint` over the PR's commit range, `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm eslint:check`, `pnpm prettier:check`, `pnpm test`, then installs Chromium (`pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium`) and runs `pnpm test:e2e`.

### Styling & UI

- Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/postcss` only — no `autoprefixer`/`postcss`, v4 uses Lightning CSS internally). Global styles live in `src/app/styles/globals.css`, which also imports `tw-animate-css` and the shadcn base stylesheet (`shadcn/tailwind.css`).
- Dark mode follows the system preference: the `dark:` variant is bound to `prefers-color-scheme` (`@custom-variant dark (@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark))`) and the dark tokens are redefined on `:root` inside the same media query, instead of shadcn's `.dark` class. A project that needs a manual theme toggle switches both to a class (e.g. with `next-themes`).
- Don't retint the default colors: keep the shadcn tokens in `globals.css` (`neutral` base color) and Tailwind's palette as they come, and pick an existing palette color instead of a custom shade (e.g. `teal-500`, not a tinted `oklch(...)`). Prefer the shadcn tokens (`bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`, ...) for surfaces and text, so both themes stay consistent. Where CSS variables can't be read (a canvas, `ImageResponse`), copy the palette value and name it in a comment.
- **shadcn/ui** (`components.json`, style `base-nova`, base color `neutral`, icon library `lucide`) is the component library: reach for a shadcn component before writing one from scratch. `Button` and `Card` are in place so far (`src/app/components/ui/shadcn/{button,card}.tsx`). Add components with `pnpm shadcn:add <name>` (wraps `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add`) — aliases and target paths are in `components.json`. Components from other shadcn registries are added the same way (`pnpm shadcn:add @<registry>/<name> --path src/app/components/ui/<registry>`), after declaring the registry in `components.json`; pin any dependency the CLI installs with `^`.
- Links that need to look like a `Button` (e.g. external CTAs) must stay plain `<a>`/`Link` elements styled with the exported `buttonVariants(...)` helper, not `Button` itself — Base UI's `Button` enforces button semantics (`role="button"`, keyboard handling) and its own docs say not to render links through it.
- Supporting libs: `@base-ui/react` (headless primitives), `class-variance-authority` for variant styling, `cn` for the `cn()` class-merging helper (imported directly from the `cn` package, as the shadcn components do; there is no `lib/utils.ts` re-export, see https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog/2026-09-cn), `lucide-react` for icons. Before wiring up a Base UI primitive, check its docs in `node_modules/@base-ui/react/docs/react/` (`components/`, `utils/`, `handbook/`) for its semantics/keyboard behavior — component APIs there may differ from other headless UI kits.

## Development Workflow

The end-to-end flow (planning, issues, branches, commits, pull requests and closing) is described in [`docs/development-workflow.md`](./docs/development-workflow.md). Follow it for any issue.

## Branch Rules

Work for an issue is committed on a new branch, never directly on `main`. Branch names follow `<scope>/<title>#<issue>`, or `<scope>(<target>)/<title>#<issue>` when the work is very specific:

- `<scope>` is one of the semantic prefixes from the Commit Rules below, without the emoji (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, ...).
- `(<target>)` is optional: the page, component or other specific area the work touches (e.g. `home`, `card`).
- `<title>` is a short, lowercase, hyphen-separated summary in English.
- `#<issue>` is the number of the associated issue.

Examples: `feat/home-page#3`, `fix(card)/focus-ring#7`. Parentheses and `#` are special characters in shells, so quote the branch name in commands (e.g. `git switch -c 'fix(card)/focus-ring#7'`).

## Issue Rules

Before closing an issue, tick every completed checklist item (`- [x]`) in its body, e.g. with `gh issue edit <number> --body-file <file>`. Don't close an issue that still has unchecked items unless they were dropped or moved, and say so in the closing comment.

## Documentation Rules

`AGENTS.md` and `README.md` record only project conventions: what to do, where things live and how to handle a given case. Answers to the user's one-off questions (e.g. "why don't we use X?") stay in the conversation and are not written into them. Keep a "why" only when it prevents a likely mistaken "fix". If a change touches a convention, update both files in the same branch.

## Task Rules

Never start working on a task on your own, even when asked to move on to the next one or in auto/agentic mode. First present a summary of the plan (the issue, branch name, steps, files touched and any open decisions) and wait for explicit approval before creating the branch, installing dependencies or editing code. Read-only investigation (issues, docs, code) needs no approval.

## Commit Rules

Never run `git commit` on your own, even in auto/agentic mode. Only propose a commit message when the user asks for one, and create the commit only after explicit approval of that message.

Commit messages must be in English and follow this format:

- Use the following semantic prefixes: `🎉 init, ✨ feat, 🐛 fix, 📚 docs, 💎 style, 📦 refactor, 🚀 perf, 🚨 test, 🛠 build, ⚙️ ci, ♻️ chore, 🗑 revert`
- The message must be in the imperative mood and in lowercase.
- Write the commit body.
- Reference an associated issue by number, if it exists, using the format `Issue: #<number>`.

Example:

```text
✨ feat: add product page

Add the new product page for the product listing with the following features:
- Create a new product
- Update a product
- Delete a product

Issue: #1
```
