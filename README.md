# Next Boilerplate

A starting point for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router) projects with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

It's general-purpose, but not entirely neutral: it sets up the toolchain (linting, formatting, tests, git hooks and CI) and takes a stance on the UI layer, with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) as the component library and its default theme and Tailwind's default palette kept as they come. It takes no stance on database, ORM, auth, data fetching, state management, hosting or any other dependency: each project picks its own.

## Getting Started

Create a project from this boilerplate:

```bash
pnpm create next-app -e https://github.com/diasjoaovitor/next-boilerplate
```

Install the dependencies and start the development server (Node version in `.nvmrc`, package manager: pnpm):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project conventions

The full conventions live in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), and the step-by-step flow from planning to merge is in [`docs/development-workflow.md`](./docs/development-workflow.md); the highlights are below.

### Tooling

- **Package manager:** pnpm only. Versions in `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are pinned exact (install with `pnpm add -E <pkg>`).
- **Node:** version pinned in `.nvmrc` (`lts/krypton`) and, for hosts that ignore `.nvmrc` such as Vercel, in `engines.node` (`24.x`) in `package.json`.
- **React Compiler:** enabled via `reactCompiler: true` in `next.config.ts`.
- **Path alias:** `@/*` resolves to `src/*`.

### Project structure

- `src/app` holds frontend-exclusive code only. Routes live in the `src/app/(pages)` route group (which does not affect the URL), shared components live in `src/app/components`, React hooks in `src/app/hooks` and other helpers in `src/app/helpers`. There are no `index.ts` barrels: modules are imported directly from their files through the `@/` alias.
- Components are grouped by role: `ui/` for visual building blocks (shadcn ones in `ui/shadcn/`), `blocks/` for composed pieces reused across pages (grouped by domain, e.g. `blocks/post/`), `providers/` for context providers and `layouts/` for page shells, whose private parts live in a `_components/` folder next to them.
- Global styles live in `src/app/styles/globals.css`.
- Anything that is not frontend-exclusive, such as `src/tests`, sits directly under `src`, as a sibling of `app`.

### Styling and UI

- **Tailwind CSS v4** through `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- **shadcn/ui** (style `base-nova`, base color `neutral`, `lucide` icons) on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com), with `class-variance-authority` and the `cn()` helper from the `cn` package. It's the component library of choice: reach for a shadcn component before writing one from scratch. Components land in `src/app/components/ui/shadcn/`; add more with `pnpm shadcn:add <name>`.
- **Default colors as they come:** the shadcn tokens and the Tailwind palette aren't retinted. Use the tokens (`bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`, ...) for surfaces and text, and pick an existing palette color (e.g. `teal-500`) instead of a custom shade.
- **Dark mode** follows the system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`).
- Links that look like buttons stay `<a>`/`Link` elements styled with `buttonVariants(...)`, never rendered through `Button`.

### Linting and formatting

- **ESLint** (flat config) extends `eslint-config-next` and adds the `unicorn`, `simple-import-sort`, `tailwindcss`, `promise` and `prefer-arrow-functions` plugins, plus `@eslint/json` and `@eslint/markdown`.
- **Prettier** with single quotes, no semicolons and no trailing commas. Indentation and whitespace are enforced by `.editorconfig`.
- Scripts: `pnpm eslint:check`, `pnpm eslint:fix`, `pnpm prettier:check`, `pnpm prettier:fix` and `pnpm type-check`.

### Code comments

- Comments only record why a decision was made, ideally with a reference (docs, issue or upstream bug), never what the code does. They are written in English.

### Testing

- **Unit tests:** Vitest with `jsdom` and Testing Library. Run `pnpm test` (once) or `pnpm test:watch`. Only `src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}` files are picked up.
- **E2E tests:** Playwright (Chromium) in `src/tests/e2e`. Run `pnpm test:e2e` or `pnpm test:e2e:ui`. The dev server starts automatically.
- Only the logic we wrote is tested, not library or framework behavior.

### Git hooks and CI

- **Husky hooks:**
  - `pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` (Prettier, ESLint and `vitest related` on staged files).
  - `commit-msg` adds the emoji prefix and runs `commitlint`.
  - `pre-push` runs `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm test:e2e`.
- **Commit messages** are written in English, in the imperative mood and lowercase, with a semantic prefix, for example `✨ feat: add product page`. Typing `feat: ...` is enough, since the hook adds the emoji.
- **Branches:** work for each issue goes on a new branch named `<scope>/<title>#<issue>`, where `<scope>` is the commit prefix without the emoji, for example `feat/home-page#3`. For very specific work, add an optional target in parentheses (a page, component or other area), for example `fix(card)/focus-ring#7`. Nothing for an issue is committed directly to `main`.
- **Issues** are created from the **Task** template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`). Tick every completed checklist item in the issue body before closing it.
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request: commitlint, type-check, ESLint, Prettier, unit tests and E2E tests.

### AI assistant setup

- `AGENTS.md` (imported by `CLAUDE.md`) documents the project conventions for coding agents.
- `.mcp.json` configures the `context7` (library docs) and `playwright` MCP servers.
- `.claude/` contains a `new-component` skill for adding shadcn or shared components, a `ui-reviewer` subagent that reviews UI semantics and accessibility, and a `settings.json` that asks for confirmation before every `git commit`.

#### Context7 API key

`.mcp.json` reads the key from the `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable (`"Authorization": "Bearer ${CONTEXT7_API_KEY}"`), so it never lands in the repository. Claude Code expands the variable on startup.

1. Generate an API key in the [Context7](https://context7.com) dashboard.
2. Set the variable using one of these options:
   - **Shell (all projects):** export it in your shell profile. In fish, run `set -Ux CONTEXT7_API_KEY <your-key>`. In bash or zsh, add `export CONTEXT7_API_KEY=<your-key>` to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.
   - **This project only:** add it to `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is git-ignored:

     ```json
     {
       "env": {
         "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "<your-key>"
       }
     }
     ```

3. Restart Claude Code and run `/mcp` to check that `context7` is connected.

Never put the key in `.mcp.json` or in `.claude/settings.json`, since both are committed.
